		Drone Issues</br>
		</h2>
		<h3>
		Drones are like any other invention, they are designed to help the user complete a task more effectivly. But like many inventions they can be used for less moral and appropriate reasons. 
		Saftey is a major concern due to users inexperiance or lack of maintance when up in the air the user may loose control causeing the drone to fall to the ground. If this
		happens over densely populated areas such as cities, or residential areas the drone could fall onto a bystander and cause serious damage.
		Along with saftey drones that are equipt with camera's can violate one's right to privacy here in the United States. There have been many cases in which a drone user attempts to record
		sensitive information or does not respect others privacy by recording them on private property. The United States Federal Government has yet to find an appropriate way to react to these
		drones since the 1st amendment does cover your freedom of press and speach which includes photography and videography. So its a battle of your right to privacy and your freedom of speech.
		This is even more complex due to recreational use only recently dramatically inclined. According to Business Insider "Most growth in the drone industry is on the commercial/civilian side...
		The market for commercial/civilian drones will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% between 2015 and 2020" So the question is what is defined as freedom of speech?

“I think the two big issues for aerial robots in particular are safety and privacy…you have any aviation risk when you have something flying around in the air that could go out of control and land in a way that is not desired.”
We cannot alter or destroy the rights of citizens which is why this drone issue is a complex problem, it is individual righs vs</br>
individual rights. Drones should not be banned but they should be regulated for the privacy of indivuals and the protection of sensative 
information. Many will say limiting drones will infringe on their freedom of press but it would all depend on how you execute
the limitations. Our idea is not to limit the drone itself but the areas it is allowed to opperate in. For example it is legal</br> 
to fly a drone above public property and record video or take photographs. But on private property it is illegal unless authorized</br>
by the owner. You can change the legal deffinition of public property or even break it up into different types of property and </br>
define the legal capabilities of each type of property and where those different properties are located. By defining new</br>
property and limits with that property you can limit flight and videography/photography. This would not infringe on United States
citizens rights but only where you can express the extent of your individual rights.
