-What is a drone?
Professor em. DR Armin Gruen
Principal investor
Future Cities Laboratory, Singapore-ETH Centre
“There are basically 4 areas of use one's documentation… 
The second one is inspection….Then you have monitoring...
Then there’s also a Support function where you have for instance people to rescue people”
Dr Pablo Valdivia y Alvarado
Research Scientist
“Robots are a tool that allows us humans to go places where we can not go.”
Eugene Lau
Executive Architect
“The urban redevelopment authority makes use of drones to capture aerial 
images of different planning areas for the purpose of documenting development
 progress and in addition we make use of these images and videos to produce in
 house materials, fly-thru’s in order to better engage the community”
Drones are mostly commonly used for their military use, but there are more ways
 than one a drone can assist humanity in our daily lives. Drones are used to carry 
 small loads and are currently being tested as 
shipping alternatives by amazon. Drones are also very intriguing to watch and can 
captivate many audiances by preforming mid flight tricks, and obstacles. Drones are
 also used for video and aerial photography which can help
get you that nice angle you were looking for your video or photo gallery. 
Contruction sites can also use drones to get around the construction site fast
 and observe areas of the site faster and with more conveinece making 
the project easier to manage.</br></br></br></br>
