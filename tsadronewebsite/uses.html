Uses
</h2>
<h3>
Drones are mostly commonly used for their military use, but there are more ways than one a drone can assist humanity in our daily lives. Drones are used to carry small loads and are currently being tested as 
shipping alternatives by amazon. Drones are also very intriguing to watch and can captivate many audiances by preforming mid flight tricks, and obstacles. Drones are also used for video and aerial photography which can help
get you that nice angle you were looking for your video or photo gallery. Contruction sites can also use drones to get around the construction site fast and observe areas of the site faster and with more conveinece making 
the project easier to manage.
