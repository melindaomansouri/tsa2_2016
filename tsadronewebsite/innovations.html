Breif History
</h2>
<h3>
The first truly successful Radio Control aircraft was the Big Guff, built in 1938 by the Good brothers, Walt and Bill.</br>
They had designed a more traditional airplane unlike today's quadcopters, designed for stability and stationary flight,</br>
the Big Guff had to constantly glide. Fast forward 32 years in 1970 remote controlled planes became popular and more accessible with
remote control kits and air frames being sold to the public at local hobbies stores. After RC vehicles became a more common
hobby, innovations began to spring more rapidly by individual users and industries. Such as jet powered RC aircraft and the
first quadcopter created by a company called Draganfly Innovations Incorporated. Founded in 1998 by Zenon and Christine Dragan,
Draganfly Innovations Inc. started as a small mail-order business specializing in radio controlled flying machines. They soon
began selling their unique, four-rotor helicopter, called the Draganflyer. The design of the quadcopter became the standard for
entry level drones for aerial video/photography and recreational use.

Current Developments
</h2>
<h3>
Today drones are getting smaller and their equipment is getting more adaptable. With more compact camera's coming out such as
the Gopro Hero series drones are getting smaller, lighter, and more affordable. Newer drones come with GPS systems and some can be
programmed easily to follow a specific flight paths without constant monitoring by the user. Along with GPS some drones will even 
follow the users using a modular tracking device. We can expect to see drones becoming a more popular way to obtain aerial footage.</br>
