			of aerial photography using traditional helicopter photography,
			Using lidar scanners on the ground. The benefit includes using 
			lesser man-hours to produce better results, cost wise it is so
			much lower, but another use would be that, for example you can
			get much lower angle aerial videos that you could never have gotten
			using traditional helicopters”</br>
			“I think the two big issues for aerial robots
			in particular are safety and privacy…you have
			any aviation risk when you have something flying
			around in the air that could go out of control and
			land in a way that is not desired.”

			“In using drones you must remember that the current
			privacy laws that governs you holding a camera on a
			street in a public space still apply, with that in 
			mind you should always use your drone in a very considerate
			manner while flying you have to keep a lookout, don’t do overhead
			flying, act responsibly check your equipment regularly and try to
			keep this activity safe for everyone.”
