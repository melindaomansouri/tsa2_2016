<br /><br /><strong>Webmaster:</strong> Participants (one team of three to five individuals per chapter) are required to design, build, and launch a website that features their school's career and technology/engineering program, the TSA chapter, and the chapter’s ability to research and present a given topic pertaining to technology. Semifinalists participate in an on-site interview to demonstrate the knowledge and expertise gained during the development of the website - with an emphasis on web design methods and practices, as well as their research for the annual design topic.

<br /><br /><strong>Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Production:</strong> Participants (one team of two individuals per chapter, one entry per team) design, fabricate, and demonstrate their ability to use a CNC machine to produce a device based on a problem posted on the TSA website.

<br /><br /><strong>Desktop Publishing:</strong> Participants (three individuals per state) produce a portfolio containing a news release, a three-column newsletter, and a poster. Semifinalists work to solve an on-site problem to demonstrate their abilities to use the computer to design and edit materials for an in-house publication.

<br /><br /><strong>Software Development:</strong> Participants (one team per chapter) work as part of a team to participate in the development, debugging, and documentation of a software design project using freely available software development toolkits. Through a multimedia presentation and documentation, the team explains its knowledge of the software development process.

<br /><br /><strong>Digital Video Production:</strong> Participants (three teams per state, one entry per team) develop a digital video/film that focuses on the current year’s theme. Sound should accompany the film.

<br /><br /><strong>Dragster Design:</strong> Participants (two individuals per chapter, one entry per individual) design, produce working drawings for, and build a CO2-powered dragster.

<br /><br /><strong>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) 2D, Architecture:</strong> Participants (two individuals per state) create representations, such as foundation and/or floor plans, and/or elevation drawings, and/or details of architectural ornamentation or cabinetry.

<br /><br /><strong>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) 3D, Engineering:</strong> Participants (two individuals per state) create 3D computer model(s) of an engineering or machine object, such as a machine part, tool, device, or manufactured product.

<br /><br /><strong>Computer Numerical Control (CNC):</strong> Production Participants (one team of two individuals per chapter, one entry per team) design, fabricate, and demonstrate their ability to use a CNC machine to produce a device based on a problem posted on the TSA website.

<br /><br /><strong>Engineering Design:</strong> Participants (one team of three to five individuals per chapter, one entry per team) work to design and fabricate a device that will meet the specific needs of a person with a disability. Through use of a model/prototype, display, and portfolio, participants document and justify their identified problem and solution, as well as the solution’s impact on a member of their community and on society. Semifinalists justify and demonstrate their solution in a timed presentation.

<br /><br /><strong>Debating Technological Issues:</strong> Participants (three teams of two individuals per state) work together to prepare for a debate against a team from another chapter. Teams are instructed on site to take either the pro or con side of a subtopic (which falls under a general topic) that is designated annually.

<br /><br /><strong>Technology Problem Solving:</strong> Participants (one team of two individuals per chapter) work together on site to develop and create a solution to a problem using the limited materials provided and the tools allowed.
