	<p>
Students will develop a solid foundation of pre-engineering, research, and design skills as well as learn concepts from the “Project Lead the Way” program. Project Lead the Way (PLTW) is the leading provider of rigorous and innovative Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education curricular programs used in middle and high schools across the U.S. STEM education is at the heart of today’s high-tech, high-skill global economy. The hand’s-on, project based engineering courses that we have at the school engage students on multiple levels, expose them to areas of study that they typically do not pursue, and provide them with a foundation and proven path to college and career success. Students may register for up to 2 engineering courses per year as a junior and senior.
