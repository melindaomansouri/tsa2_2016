	<h2>Engineering</h2>
	<p>Engineering consists of four courses to help students understand the field of engineering and engineering technology. Students will develop a solid foundation of pre-engineering, research, and design skills as will as learning concepts from the "Project Lead the Way" program. The hands-on, project based engineering courses that we have at the school engage students on multiple levels, expose them to areas of study that they typically do not pursue, and provide them with a foundation and proven path to college an career success. Students may register for up to two engineering courses per year as a junior and senior.
